# FootballManager
Football Manager is a free and open source game, where you become a manager of the football club of your choosing. You can manage your squad, change training plans, buy and sell players, and much more!

## Alpha Version
The game is currently in Alpha version, with a lot of work needed to be done. A lot of planned features are not currently implemented or do not work correctly. You can contact me on Slack to suggest new features.

## Future Updates
Football Manager will keep receiving updates for a while. One of the major planned updates is a full UI redesign, ability to buy and sell players, manage finances, upgrade and manage club facilities, recalculation of all club starting budgets, and adding a visualization of match simulations.
